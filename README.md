- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @toyinariyo and I am a software developer. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end + backend development, cybersecurity and AI/machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to design responsive websites with HTML + CSS through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/), learning how to use Python through [Angela Yu's Python bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) and learning back-end web development through [@bootdotdev](https://github.com/bootdotdev).
