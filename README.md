- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @toyinariyo and I'm a game designer & software developer. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web design (HTML, CSS + JavaScript), cybersecurity and games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to design responsive websites with HTML + CSS through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) and learning how to use Python through [Angela Yu's Python bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
